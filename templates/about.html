                                the initial concept to the final product launch, we've poured our hearts and souls into
                                every aspect of this project. We've spent countless hours researching, testing, and

                            <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 15px;">Exercise Assistant harnesses the latest advancements in AI, machine learning, and web
                                development to deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience. Our backend is powered
                                by
                                Python and the Flask framework, providing a robust and scalable foundation for our
                                application. We leverage MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring fast
                                and
                                reliable access to our extensive library of exercises. On the frontend, we use HTML,
                                CSS,
                                and JavaScript to create a visually stunning and responsive interface that adapts
                                seamlessly
                                to any device. Additionally, we employ AI pose estimation libraries such as MediaPipe to
                                accurately analyze users' movements and provide personalized feedback in real-time.
